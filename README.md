# About
Communote is a lean web-based social communication platform for teams and organizations. 
It combines the ideas of transparent messaging, blogging, activity streams with superior tagging 
and filtering into a single easy to use web interface.

The communote-server repository contains the Communote core which is a Java servlet based web application with an embedded OSGi container. It consists of the main artifacts and a set of OSGi plugins, the so called 'core plugins', which will be bundled in official Communote releases.

Instructions for building can be found in our [Developer Documentation](http://communote.github.io/doc/dev_how_core.html).
